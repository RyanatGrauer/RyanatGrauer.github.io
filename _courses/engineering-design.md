# Engineering Design

## Course Overview

This class will enable you to explore your creativity and expand your knowledge of the world around you through the lens of an engineer. We will learn the steps of the design process and practice brainstorming new ideas. We will also develop skills with the tools of the engineer, including Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and programming with Arduino devices. Together we will work to make it possible for you to bring your own ideas from concept to creation.

## What You'll Learn

- **Design Process**: Learn systematic approaches to engineering problems
- **CAD Software**: Master 3D modeling and technical drawing
- **Arduino Programming**: Code microcontrollers for real-world applications
- **Prototyping**: Build and test your designs
- **Problem Solving**: Think like an engineer to solve complex challenges
- **Project Management**: Plan and execute engineering projects from start to finish

## Course Projects

Throughout the year, you'll work on exciting projects such as:
- Designing and 3D printing functional objects
- Building automated systems with Arduino
- Creating solutions to real-world problems
- Collaborative engineering challenges
