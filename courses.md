## Engineering Design

This class will enable you to explore your creativity and expand your knowledge of the world around you through the 
lens of an engineer. We will learn the steps of the design process and practice brainstorming new ideas. We will also 
develop skills with the tools of the engineer, including Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and programming with Arduino 
devices. Together we will work to make it possible for you to bring your own ideas from concept to creation.
